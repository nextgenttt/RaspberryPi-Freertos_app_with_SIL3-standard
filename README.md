# RaspberryPi-mini UART driver and Freertos_app_with_SIL3-standard
Updating Freertos source code with IEC61508 standards and showcasing the test scenarios on console/gpio-led

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Test Setup:

a. console Hardware Connections
     You should have ttl-to-rs232 cable to use mini-uart. Connect 5v, tx, rx, gnd pins from RPI3 to ttl cable.
     On Ubuntu, run minicom
       sudo killall -9 minicom ; sudo minicom --device /dev/ttyUSB0
     
b. Build and Flash application
    Type make
    You need to modify the arm-non-eabi- toolchain locations in the Makefile:
    kernel.elf: LDFLAGS += -L"/usr/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/4.9.3" -lgcc
    kernel.elf: LDFLAGS += -L"/usr/lib/arm-none-eabi/lib" -lc
    On Ubuntu you can install the toolchain with: sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi

   Format your SD card as FAT32
   Copy the bootcode.bin and start.elf from here https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot

   Copy the config.txt from /boot_stuff onto the SD card to fix over/underscanning

   Copy the kernel7.img generated by make

Scenarios that are simulated and tested

  a. Avoid running the scheduler resources when it is invoked without any tasks in the ready/pending/suspended lists 

  Actual Behaviour : When scheduler is invoked without any tasks in the list, it unnecessarily runs the idle_task, runs the OS   timers, consumes stack/heap, measures statistics etc which takes lot of CPU cycles.

  Modified Behavior : Scheduler will verify if there are any tasks present in the ready/pending/suspended lists. If the lists are   empty, then scheduler returns with a warning to the user. Now, user can decide to go to low power mode. 

  b. Intrinsic self-verification routines

  Actual Behaviour : FreeRTOS APIs returns pdPASS or pdFAIL. If there is other fault like invalid parameter or wrong priority value   or insufficient stack or NULL parameters passed, user will not be knowing the exact issue.

  Modified Behavior : All the failure cases are addressed properly according to SIL3 guidelines and an informative warning is     returned from each function instead of True/False

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test Cases:

Test Scenario 1 for case 1 : Invoke the scheduler without creating tasks.
Expected Result            : Scheduler should not run and return OS_ERROR_COMPONENT_TASKS|errNO_TASKS_CREATED.
                             Also verify if GPIO is turned ON in the Oscilloscope.

Test Scenario 2 for case 1 : Invoke the scheduler by creating tasks which toggles the GPIO.
Expected Result            : Scheduler should run and return pdPASS.
                             Also verify if GPIO is toggling in the Oscilloscope.

Test Scenario 3 for case 1 : Invoke the scheduler repetitively.
Expected Result            : Scheduler should not create its resources again and again and should return warning.
                             Also verify if GPIO is OFF in the Oscilloscope.

Test Scenario 1 for case 2 : Invoke the xTaskCreate() function with invalid arguments. (Pass NULL instead of task_name)
Expected Result            : Scheduler should not run and return  			OS_ERROR_COMPONENT_TASKS,errTASK_CREATE_NULL_PARAMETER_SUPPLIED.
                             Also verify if GPIO is turned ON in the Oscilloscope.
